<h1>AI-Powered Loan Approval System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The AI-Powered Loan Approval System is designed to automate and optimize loan approval decisions using Machine Learning and Big Data techniques. The system analyzes historical loan application data, detects fraudulent activities, predicts credit risk, and provides AI-generated loan approval summaries.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<h2>Data Analysis & Cleaning</h2>: Preprocess historical loan data, handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure data consistency.
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>: Visualize trends in loan approval, identify key factors affecting approvals.
<h2>Big Data Fraud Detection</h2>: Use Hadoop & MongoDB to process large datasets and detect fraudulent applications.
<h2>Credit Risk Prediction</h2>: Train an ML model to predict loan default risk.
<h2>Cloud Deployment</h2>: Deploy the model on AWS for real-time decision-making.
<h2>Interactive Visualization</h2>: Use Tableau to showcase loan trends and predictions.
<h2>Generative AI Summaries</h2>: Automatically generate brief reports on loan decisions using LLMs.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<h2>Programming</h2>: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
<h2>Big Data</h2>: Hadoop, MongoDB
<h2>Cloud & Deployment</h2>: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)
<h2>Data Visualization</h2>: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
<h2>NLP & AI</h2>: Generative AI for loan summary generation

<h3>Data Processing Steps</h3>
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>: Handle missing values, convert datatypes, remove duplicates & outliers.
<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>: Extract meaningful features for model training.
<h2>Model Training</h2>: Train & evaluate ML models for credit risk prediction.
<h2>Fraud Detection</h2>: Apply anomaly detection techniques to flag suspicious applications.
<h2>Deployment</h2>: Deploy the model & API on AWS for real-time loan approvals.

<h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
Faster and more accurate loan approvals using AI.✔ Improved fraud detection with Big Data techniques.✔ Enhanced loan trend insights via Tableau dashboards.✔ AI-powered automated loan summaries for better decision-making.
